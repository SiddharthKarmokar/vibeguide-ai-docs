3. **Receive**: Personalized guidance based on:
   - Local customs
   - Time of day
   - Business vs. social context
   - Your personal style

!!! example "Sample Interaction"
    **You**: "I'm meeting a business contact in Tokyo tomorrow morning. How should I greet them?"
    
    **VibeGuide AI**: "In Japanese business culture, a respectful bow (15-30 degrees) is appropriate for first meetings. If they extend their hand for a handshake, follow their lead. Arrive 5-10 minutes early, and have your business card ready to exchange with both hands. The depth of your bow should match theirs‚Äîthis shows respect and cultural awareness."
